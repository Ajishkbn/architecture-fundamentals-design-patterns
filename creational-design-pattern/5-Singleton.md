# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    Singleton() {}

public:
    // Delete copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent copying
    Singleton(const Singleton&) = delete;
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&) = delete;

    // Static method to provide a global point of access to the instance
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (instance == nullptr) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    void showMessage() {
        std::cout << "Hello from Singleton!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Initialize the static member
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    // Get the single instance of Singleton
    Singleton* s = Singleton::getInstance();
    s->showMessage();

    return 0;
}
```

### Points to consider

- **Private Constructor**: The constructor is private to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class. This ensures that no other class can create a new instance of the Singleton class.

- **Static Instance:** The Singleton class has a private static pointer (instance) that holds the one and only instance of the class. This pointer is initialized to nullptr.

- **getInstance() Method:** This static method provides the global access point to the Singleton instance. If the instance doesn't exist (i.e., instance is nullptr), it creates the instance. If it already exists, it simply returns the existing instance.

- **Deleted Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator:** These are deleted to ensure that the Singleton instance cannot be copied or assigned, preventing multiple instances.

- **Thread Safety:** The basic implementation is not thread-safe. In a multithreaded environment, you might end up with multiple instances if two threads call getInstance() simultaneously. To make it thread-safe, you can use mutexes or other synchronization mechanisms.

- **Lazy Initialization:** The instance is only created when getInstance() is first called, which is known as lazy initialization. This can save resources if the instance is never used.

- **Global Access:** The Singleton pattern provides a global access point, which can be useful in certain scenarios but can also lead to tightly coupled code and difficulties in testing.
